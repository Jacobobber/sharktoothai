        <p>
          Sharktooth is designed to meet the security expectations of modern dealership IT environments. The following outlines how data is handled, protected, and accessed within the platform.
        </p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Data handling</h2>
        <p>
          Sharktooth processes structured repair order data for analytical purposes. The platform is designed to minimize data exposure and limit processing to what is necessary for analysis.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personally identifiable information is deterministically redacted prior to analysis</li>
          <li>Customer names, addresses, phone numbers, and VINs are not stored within the AI layer</li>
          <li>Free-form text fields are not required for core analysis</li>
          <li>Data is handled in a read-only analytical context</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Access control</h2>
        <p>
          Access to Sharktooth is restricted to authorized users and governed by role-based controls.

        <ul>
          <li>Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced</li>
          <li>Access events are logged</li>
          <li>Administrative actions are restricted and auditable</li>
          <li>Authentication is required for all application access</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Infrastructure and isolation</h2>
        <p>
          Sharktooth is deployed within isolated infrastructure designed to limit lateral access and reduce blast radius.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Application components are logically isolated</li>
          <li>Data processing is separated from public-facing services</li>
          <li>Network access is restricted to required paths only</li>
          <li>Production systems are not accessible from public endpoints beyond the application interface</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Operational security</h2>
        <p>
          Operational controls are in place to support system integrity and traceability.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Changes are managed through controlled deployment processes</li>
          <li>Errors and system events are logged</li>
          <li>Public endpoints are rate-limited</li>
          <li>Security-relevant events are reviewable</li>

        <h2>Compliance posture</h2>
        <p>
          Sharktooth is designed to align with common dealership and enterprise security expectations.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Least-privilege access principles are applied</li>
          <li>Data retention is limited to operational necessity</li>
          <li>The platform avoids direct integration paths that would require write access to dealer systems</li>
        </ul>
